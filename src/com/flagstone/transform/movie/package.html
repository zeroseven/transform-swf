<p>Transform SWF is an API for reading and writing Flash files.</p>

<p>Flash is designed to display vector graphics across the Internet and displayed 
on host devices using the Macromedia Flash Player. Flash is designed to be compact, 
extensible and platform independent. Animations delivered using Flash will be displayed 
consistently and accurately across a wide range of devices.</p>

<p>A Flash file (movie) contain a sequence of tagged data blocks.</p>

<img src="doc-files/taggedData.gif"/>

<p>Each movie starts with header information followed by a sequence of tags that 
describe how the movie is displayed. All movies end with an End tag which marks 
the end of the file.</p>

<p>The header identifies the type and version of Flash contained in the file; the 
size of screen displayed by the Flash Player; the length of file; the rate at which 
frames are displayed and the number of frames in the movie.</p>

<p>Two categories of tag are provided: <i>definition</i> tags which are used to 
describe shapes, images, buttons, sounds, etc., and <i>control</i> tags that create 
instances of the shapes, etc. and display them on the Flash Player screen to create 
animations.</p>

<p>Flash also supports actions which control the behaviour of objects in response 
to events such as a button being clicked or when a particular frame is displayed. 
Actions are represented by byte-codes and the Flash Player supports a stack-based 
programming model which provides a rich programming environment that supports complex 
behaviours. This allows Flash movies to provide all the flexibility and sophistication 
of user interfaces found in desktop computers and personal devices.</p>

<p>The Transform SWF library is a collection of classes for each of the tags and 
data structures that make up the Flash File Format. The Movie class is the principal 
class in the library. Movie objects are used to represent a complete Flash movie, 
containing instances of the classes that represent each type of tag.</p>

<p>Movie is designed to simplify the creation and manipulation of Flash files. 
Creating an instance of the class:</p>

<pre>
Movie aMovie(filename);
</pre>

<p>parses the Flash file, <em>filename</em> and creates objects for each different 
tags and data structure decoded from the file. The objects may be inspected and their 
attributes changed accordingly. Once the objects have been updated:</p>

<pre>
aMovie.writeToFile(filename);
</pre>

<p>encodes each object and generates the file according to the Macromedia Flash 
(SWF) File Format Specification.</p>

<H1 class="datasheet">1.1. Flash Programming Model</H1>

<p>Flash is, in effect, a programming language for the Flash Player. A movie contains 
definitions of objects which are created, displayed and updated to create an animation. 
In order to understand how the classes provided in Transform are used to create Flash 
movies it is essential to understand the programming model provided by the Flash Player.</p>

<img src="doc-files/player.gif">

<p>The <b>Dictionary</b> is a table that contains the definitions of the objects 
(buttons, images, sounds) that will be displayed in the movie. Each definition tag 
(represented in Transform by classes derived from Definition) contains a unique 
identifier which allows the definition to be referenced when creating instances of 
a particular shape, button, etc., to display on the screen. Entries are added to 
the dictionary whenever a definition tag is decoded from the Flash movie. Dictionary 
entries may be deleted using the Free class once a definition is no longer needed.
</p>

<p>The <b>Display List</b> controls the order in which objects are displayed on the 
screen. The display list is divided into layers. To display an object on the screen 
it is placed on a display list layer (using the PlaceObject or PlaceObject2 
classes). The layer number controls the stacking order of object when the movie is 
displayed. Objects placed on a higher layer are displayed in front on an object on 
a lower layer. Only one object can be placed on a given layer at a time so like the 
unique identifier used to create the object from its definition in the Dictionary 
the layer number can be used to refer to an object once it is on the display list. 
When placed on the Display List an object is always visible (unless hidden by another 
or moved off the visible area of the screen) until it is explicitly removed (using 
RemoveObject or RemoveObject2). Once an object is removed it is "destroyed" so 
another instance must be re-created from its definition if the object must be displayed 
again.</p>

<p>The <b>Movie List</b> is used to manage the movie and any movie clips (also known 
as sprites). The Movie List contains a number of virtual levels, analogous to the 
layers in the Display List, which are used to keep track of which movie clips are 
currently loaded. The main movie is placed automatically on _level0. Movie clips 
that are displayed within the main movie may be loaded to _level1, _level2, etc. 
Note that movie clips must still be placed on the Display List for them to become 
visible on the Screen. Loading a movie clip (using the GetUrl2 class) to a level 
replaces any clip already loaded at that level. Movies loaded to _level0 replace 
the main movie. This allows several movies sequences to be chained together into 
a single movie.</p>

<p>The <b>Screen</b> is a bit-mapped display where the Flash Player renders the 
graphics objects to create the animation. Each time a ShowFrame tag is decoded the 
objects added to the Display List are rendered on the Screen. All graphics and 
fonts are anti-aliased. The size of the Screen is defined by the frameSize attribute 
of the Movie object. Coordinates in Flash are specified in <b>twips</b> where 1 
twip equals 1/1440th of an inch or 1/20th of a point. For most practical purposes 
this can be simplified to 1 twip = 1/20th of a pixel.</p>

<p>It is important to note that in Flash the positive x and y axes extend from the 
top left corner of the screen (not from the lower left as in the Cartesian coordinate 
system). The coordinate range may also be specified in the attributes of a Flash movie 
so that the top left corner is set to an arbitrary pair of coordinates. For example 
specifying the corners at the points (-100,-100) and (100,100) defines a screen 200 
twips by 200 twips with the point (0,0) located in the centre. Specifying the points 
(0,0) and (200,200) defines a screen with the same size however the centre is now 
located at (100,100).</p>

<p>The Flash Player supports three other physical devices (through the host operating 
system) to allow a user to interact with the animation being played. Users can enter 
data and keystrokes representing commands through a keyboard. A mouse or other pointing 
device is supported to allow users to click buttons and generate events for movie clips. 
Finally the Flash Player supports CD-quality sound in mono or stereo with between 
three and eight sound channels playing simultaneously, depending on the capabilities 
of the host platform. Sounds can be played in response to specific events, such as 
a mouse being clicked or streamed with the movie to provide as sound-track as it is 
displayed. With the introduction of Flash 5, access to the keyboard and mouse are 
provided through the Key and Mouse objects and the methods they support, see 
Object-Oriented Programming below.</p>

<p>Actions executed by the Flash Player are loaded into the <b>Instruction Buffer</b>. 
Actions may be specified as part of a button definition to be executed when the button 
is clicked. Flash also allows actions to be executed whenever each frame is displayed 
(using the DoAction class). Flash does not support the concept of a program as such. 
Rather the complete movie can be regarded as the program executed by the Flash Player. 
Sequences of actions defined in DefineButton, DoAction objects are best viewed 
as procedures or sub-routines that are executed whenever a particular event occurs. 
A given set of actions are executed each and every time the corresponding event 
occurs. The Instruction Buffer is byte-addressable. Control flow within the Instruction 
Buffer is controlled by the <b>Instruction Pointer</b> which contains the address 
of the next instruction to be executed. Conditional and unconditional jumps are 
supported through the If and Jump classes respectively. Each action contains 
a 16-bit offset which is added to the address in the Instruction Pointer to obtain 
the address of the next instruction in the Instruction Buffer.</p>

<p>Calculations are performed using the <b>Stack</b>. The Push class is used to 
push values onto the stack. When actions are executed any required arguments are 
popped from the Stack and any results are pushed back on the stack then the action 
finishes executing. Values pushed onto the Stack are primarily integers or strings. 
When values are used repeatedly in a calculation the Flash Player provides the 
<b>String Table</b> and a set of 256 internal <b>Registers</b> (increased from 4 
in Flash 6) to improve efficiency. Rather than repeatedly push a string value onto 
the Stack the Table class allows an array of strings to be defined in a look-up 
table, using the Table class. A string is referenced from the table by pushing 
an TableIndex value onto the Stack. A table index only occupies 1 or 2 bytes 
in the Instruction Buffer so the space required by a sequence of actions can be 
reduced considerably using indices rather than explicitly pushing strings onto 
the stack. The Flash Player also has a set of 256 internal registers for temporarily 
storing values. Values are copied (not popped) from the top of the Stack using the 
RegisterCopy action. The contents of the register is referenced by pushing an 
RegisterIndex onto the Stack. This simplifies use of the Stack is complex calculations 
and again reduced the space required to represent a given set of actions in the 
Instruction Buffer.</p>

<p>Although calculations are performed using the Stack, Flash also supports the 
concept of named variables. Variables are stored in <b>Memory</b> which is a scratch-pad 
memory accessible only by the Flash Player. It cannot be accessed using any of 
the actions provided by Flash. Variables are fetched and set from Memory using 
the GetVariable and SetVariable actions (byte-code actions are supported using 
the Action class). The name of the variable is pushed onto the Stack and a GetVariable 
action is executed. The value of the variable is fetched form Memory and pushed 
onto the Stack by the Flash Player. Similarly to set a variable the value followed 
by the variable name are pushed onto the Stack and a SetVariable action is executed 
to update the variable in Memory.</p>

<h1 class="datasheet">1.2. A Quick Tour of Flash</h1>

<p>Flash provides a rich environment for drawing object and creating animations. 
This is a brief description of the main aspects of Flash and is intended to introduce 
the main classes available in the Transform SWF library. Examples showing how to 
use the individual classes to create Flash movies are presented on Flagstone's web 
site.</p>

<p><b>Drawing Shapes</b><br/>
Shapes are drawn using a combination Line and Curve which specify the line or 
curve to draw relative to the current drawing point. The line style is defined 
using SolidLine class - only solid lines are supported. Shapes can be filled 
with solid colour (SolidFill), an image (BitmapFill) or a colour gradient 
(GradientFill). The ShapeStyle class is used to select a particular line and 
fill style while drawing a shape. It can also change the current drawing point 
and the set of line and fill styles used for a particular shape. Shapes are defined 
using DefineShape, DefineShape2 or DefineShape3. DefineShape is the most 
commonly used class. DefineShape2 extends DefineShape to support a large number 
(greater than 65535) of line and fill styles while DefineShape3 supports transparent 
shapes.</p>

<p>Flash supports shape morphing using the DefineMorphShape class which defines 
the appearance of the start and end shapes. The interpolation between the start 
and end shapes is performed by the Flash Player. Displaying a morphing shape is 
controlled by the PlaceObject2 class which identifies the point in the morphing 
process and updates the display list with the morphed shape.</p>

<p><b>Buttons</b><br/>
Buttons are created by defining a shape for when button is up, the mouse is over 
the button or the button is clicked.DefineButton displays a button that executes 
a set of actions when it is clicked. DefineButton2 provides are more flexible 
class allowing actions to be executed for any of the states a button can occupy. 
Sounds can also be played, using the ButtonSound class, when an event occurs, 
such as the button being clicked.</p>

<p><b>Images</b><br/>
Flash supports JPEG and lossless image formats such as GIF. Several classes are 
provided which display "regular" and transparent images. Images cannot be displayed 
directly. They can only be displayed inside a shape that contains a bitmap fill 
style. Creating such "image shapes" is simple however.</p>

<p><b>Fonts and Text</b><br/>
Flash ensures consistency and quality when display text by defining the glyphs 
that represent each of the text characters displayed in a movie. Fonts are defined 
using DefineFont and DefineFont2 - the latter combines the DefineFont and 
FontInfo classes into a more convenient and flexible class. A string is defined, 
using DefineText and Text, by specifying the index of the glyph, from the font
definition, that represents a given character. Using the index of a glyph allows 
only the glyphs actually displayed to be used, greatly reducing the size of a Flash 
file. The relative placement of glyphs is also specified in the text string giving 
a high degree of control over how a piece of text is rendered.</p>

<p>Creating fonts and text directly using the Transform classes can be very 
cumbersome. Flagstone provides the <b>Transform Utilities</b> library that allows 
fonts and text to be created from existing Flash or Java font definitions greatly 
simplifying the process.</p>

<p>Text fields can be created using the DefineTextField class. This class is 
very flexible and can be used to create editable text fields that allow users to 
submit information to a server in the same way as HTML forms.</p>

<p><b>Sound</b><br/>
Flash can supports sounds that are played when an event occurs such as a button 
being clicked (DefineSound) or streaming sound that allows a soundtrack to be 
played while displaying a movie (SoundStreamHead, SoundStreamBlock). Flash can 
play sounds that are compressed using ADPCM or MP3. A high degree of control over 
the sound is available - an envelope can be created that controls how a sound fades 
in and fades out (Sound).</p>

<p><b>Movie Clips</b><br/>
Movie Clips (sprites) contain "pre-packaged" animation sequences that liven up a 
movie. Movie clip are defined using the DefineMovie class. A Flash file can 
contain all the required movie clips or they can be loaded on demand using the 
GetUrl and GetUrl2 classes.</p>

<p><b>Display List</b><br/>
Shapes, buttons, images and text are placed on the display list using the 
PlaceObject and PlaceObject2 classes. Objects can be removed from the display 
list using RemoveObject and RemoveObject2.</p>

<p><b>Timelines</b><br/>
A Flash file is composed of a series of frames. Each frame contains definitions 
of objects to be displayed and the sequence of commands used to update the display 
list. Frames in a movie are displayed using the ShowFrame class. This instructs 
the Flash Player to display all the objects currently in the display list. 
Successive frames in a movie or movie clip are delimited by successive ShowFrame 
objects. The timeline is controlled by GotoFrame, GotoFrame2 and GotoLabel 
actions which instruct the Flash Player to play the movie or clip starting at a 
particular frame.</p>

<p><b>Actions</b><br/>
Actions are executed when a frame is displayed, a button is clicked or an event 
occurs in a movie clip. The DoAction class is used to define the list of actions 
for a given frame. The ButtonEvent class defines actions for a button and the 
ClipEvent class in conjunction with the PlaceObject2 class is used to define 
the events for a movie clip.</p>

<p>Push is used to push integers, strings, double precision floating point 
numbers onto the Stack. The byte-codes that represent stack-based actions are 
supported using the Action class. The type assigned to instances of this class 
identify the type of action to be executed.</p>

<p>Control flow is performed using If and Jump.</p>

<p>GetUrl and GetUrl2 are used to load web pages, movies and movie clips. 
GetUrl2 also allows variables to be loaded and submitted to and from a remote 
server. XML formatted data can also be exchanged using the XMLSocket class allowing 
direct communication with a server process.</p>

<h1 class="datasheet">1.3. Object-Oriented Programming</h1>

<p>With the introduction of Flash 5 the concept of classes and objects (in the 
programming sense) was introduced to Flash. The Flash Player supports several 
pre-defined classes for different data types such as Strings, Integers and XML 
formatted data structures. Classes are also used access to system resources such 
as the mouse or other pointing device supported by the host device. The Flash 
Player also supports <b>Socket</b> objects which allow XML formatted data to be 
exchanged between the Flash Player and a remote server.</p>

<p>Objects are instantiated and assigned to variables in Memory. Instances of 
pre-defined classes (String, Integer, etc.) are created by pushing any arguments 
followed by the name of the class onto the Stack then executing a NamedObject 
action. Methods are executed by pushing the arguments, if any, followed by a 
reference to the object (usually through a variable) and a string containing the 
name of a method. The ExecuteMethod pops the items from the stack and executes 
the function associated with the method definition, returning any results to the 
stack.</p>

<p>User defined classes and objects can also be defined and created. User-defined 
classes are created by pushing pairs of strings and default values onto the Stack 
for each member variable then executing the NewObject action. A reference to the 
object in memory is pushed on the Stack. Assigning this reference to a variable 
allows the object to be referenced in future calculations. Methods can be defined 
by using the NewFunction class to define a function and then assigning it to a 
member variable of the class using the SetAttribute action. Methods can be executed 
using the ExecuteMethod action using the same sequence of operations described 
previously.</p>

<p>The introduction of classes and objects is significant. Future releases of 
Flash and the Flash Player can have new functionality added using the general 
purpose mechanism describe above for creating objects and executing methods 
without adding new tags to the file format specification.</p>

<h1 class="datasheet">1.4. ActionScript</h1>

<p>ActionScript is a high-level language provided by Macromedia to control and 
manipulate objects using the Flash authoring program. ActionScript is compiled 
into the byte-codes and actions supported by Transform when a movie is encoded 
to the Flash file format. Programming directly using the actions defined in Transform 
is analogous to assembly-language programming for microprocessors. Creating programs 
at this low level is relatively cumbersome, prone to error and difficult to debug. 
To address this, Flagstone developed <b>Translate</b>, a Java based program that 
compiles ActionScript into the objects supported in the Transform SWF Library. This 
greatly simplifies the creation of programs that can be used in Flash files. Although 
Translate is current only available for Java, compiled scripts can easily be added 
to programs developed in C++ by compiling the ActionScript and encoding the objects 
to a Flash file. The file can then be parsed using the Movie class and the compiled 
actions extracted and added to the relevant objects in the current movie.</p>

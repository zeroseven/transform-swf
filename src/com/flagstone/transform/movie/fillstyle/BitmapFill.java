/**
 * <p>
 * BitmapFill is used to display an image inside a shape. An image cannot be
 * displayed directly, it must be displayed inside of a shape using this style.
 * The style controls how the image is displayed inside the shape. Images may be
 * clipped if they are too large to fit or tiled across the available area if
 * they are too small. A coordinate transform can also be used to change its
 * size, location relative to the origin of the shape, orientation, etc., when
 * it is displayed. Four types of bitmap fill are supported:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Clipped - If the image is larger than the shape then it will be clipped.
 * Conversely if the area to be filled is larger than the image the colour at
 * the edge of the image is used to fill the remainder of the shape.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Tiled - if the area to be filled is larger than the image then the image
 * is tiled to fill the area, otherwise as with the Clipped style the colour at
 * the edge of the image will be use to fill the space available.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Unsmoothed Clipped - Same as Clipped but if the image is smaller than the
 * shape the colour used to fill the space available is not smoothed. This style
 * was added to increase performance with few visible artifacts.</li>
 * 
 * <li>Unsmoothed Tiled - Same as Tiled but no smoothing is applied if the
 * colour at the edge of the image is used to fill the space available. Again
 * this was introduced to increase performance.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The most common use of the coordinate transform is to scale an image so it
 * displayed at the correct resolution. When an image is loaded its width and
 * height default to twips rather than pixels. An image 300 x 200 pixels will be
 * displayed as 300 x 200 twips (15 x 10 pixels). Scaling the image by 20 (20
 * twips = 1 pixel) using the CoordTransform object will restore it to its
 * original size.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The coordinate transform is also used to control the image registration. An
 * image is drawn with the top left corner placed at the origin (0, 0) of the
 * shape being filled. The transform can be used to apply different translations
 * to the image so its position can be adjusted relative to the origin of the
 * enclosing shape.
 * </p>

 * @see DefineShape2

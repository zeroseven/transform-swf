/**
 * LineStyle1 defines the width and colour of a line that is used when drawing
 * the outline of a shape.
 *
 * <p>
 * All lines are drawn with rounded corners and end caps. Different join and
 * line end styles can be created by drawing line segments as a sequence of
 * filled shapes. With 1 twip equal to 1/20th of a pixel this technique can
 * easily be used to draw the narrowest of visible lines. Note that specific
 * join and cap styles can be specified with the {@link LineStyle2} class.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Whether the alpha channel in the colour is used is determined by the class
 * used to define the shape. Transparent colours are only supported from Flash 3
 * onwards. Simply specifying the level of transparency in the Color object is
 * not sufficient.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Flash only supports contiguous lines. Dashed line styles can be created by
 * drawing the line as a series of short line segments by interspersing
 * ShapeStyle objects to move the current point in between the Line objects that
 * draw the line segments.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see LineStyle2

/**
 * The Jump action performs an unconditional branch to control the actions
 * executed by the Flash Player.
 *
 * <p>
 * When executed the Jump action adds an offset to the instruction pointer and
 * execution of the stream of actions continues from that address.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Although the Flash Player contains an instruction pointer it does not support
 * an explicit address space. The instruction pointer is used to reference
 * actions within the current stream of actions being executed whether they are
 * associated with a given frame, button or movie clip. The value contained in
 * the instruction pointer is the address relative to the start of the current
 * stream.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The offset is a signed number allowing branches up to -32768 to 32767 bytes.
 * The instruction pointer points to the next instruction so specifying an
 * offset of zero will have no effect on the sequence of instructions executed.
 * </p>

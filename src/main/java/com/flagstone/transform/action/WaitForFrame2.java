/**
 * The WaitForFrame2 action instructs the player to wait until the specified
 * frame number or named frame has been loaded.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the frame has been loaded then the following <i>n</i> actions are
 * executed. The WaitForFrame2 action extends the WaitForFrame action by
 * allowing the name of a frame to be specified.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * WaitForFrame2 is a stack-based action. The frame number or frame name which
 * should be loaded to trigger execution of the following actions is popped from
 * the Flash Player's stack. Note however that this method of waiting until a
 * frame has been loaded is considered obsolete. Determining the number of
 * frames loaded using the FramesLoaded property of the Flash player in
 * combination with an If action is now preferred.
 * </p>

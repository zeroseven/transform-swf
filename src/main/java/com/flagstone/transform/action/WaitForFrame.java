/**
 * The WaitForFrame action instructs the player to wait until the specified
 * frame number has been loaded.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the frame has been loaded then the actions in the following <i>n</i>
 * actions are executed. This action is most often used to execute a short
 * animation loop that plays until the main part of a movie has been loaded.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This method of waiting until a frame has been loaded is considered obsolete.
 * Determining the number of frames loaded using the FramesLoaded property of
 * the Flash player in combination with an If action is now the preferred
 * mechanism.

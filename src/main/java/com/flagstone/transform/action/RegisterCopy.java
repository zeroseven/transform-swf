/**
 * RegisterCopy is used to copy the item at the top of the stack to one of the
 * Flash Player's internal registers.
 *
 * <p>
 * The Flash Player uses a stack to store values when executing the actions
 * associated with a button being pushed, frame being played, etc. If a value is
 * used repeatedly in a calculation, it must be pushed onto the stack each time
 * using an Push action. To speed up the execution of the calculation and reduce
 * the amount of code required the value can be saved to one of the internal
 * registers of the Flash Player using the RegisterCopy action. This copies the
 * value currently at the top of the stack into the specified register. Pushing
 * an RegisterIndex object onto the stack creates a reference to the register so
 * the Flash Player uses the value directly rather than pushing the value onto
 * the stack then immediately popping to use the value in a calculation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The value is not removed from the stack. The number of registers supported
 * was expanded in Flash 7 from 4 to 256.
 * </p>

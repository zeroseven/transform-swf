/**
 * GetUrl is used to display a web page or load a movie clip into the Flash
 * Player.
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition to the URL to be loaded, GetUrl also contains a target which is
 * either a level in the Flash Player where the movie clip will be loaded or
 * frame or window in the browser where the web page will be displayed. The
 * following reserved words may be used to identify a specific frame or window
 * in a web browser:
 * </p>
 *
 * <table class="datasheet">
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top"><code>_blank</code></td>
 * <td>opens the new page in a new window.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top"><code>_self</code></td>
 * <td>opens the new page in the current window.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top"><code>_top</code></td>
 * <td>opens the new page in the top level frame of the current window.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top"><code>_parent</code></td>
 * <td>opens the new page in the parent frame of the frame where the Flash
 * Player id displayed.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top"><code>""</code></td>
 * <td>(blank string) opens the new page in the current frame or window.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>
 * To load a movie clip into the currently playing movie then the target is a
 * string literal of the form "_level<i>n</i>". The Flash Player supports the
 * concept of virtual layers (analogous to the layers in the Display List).
 * Higher levels are displayed in front of lower levels. The background of each
 * level is transparent allowing movie clips on lower levels to be visible in
 * areas not filled by the movie clip on a given level. The main movie is loaded
 * into _level0. Movie clips are loaded into any level above this (1, 2, 3,
 * ...). If a movie clip is loaded into a level that already contains a movie
 * clip then the existing clip is replaced by the new one.
 * </p>

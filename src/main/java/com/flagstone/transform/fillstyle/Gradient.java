/**
 * Gradient defines a control point that is used to specify how a gradient
 * colour is displayed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Two or more control points are used to define how the colour changes across
 * the gradient square. Each control point specifies the ratio indicating the
 * location of the control point across the gradient square and the colour to be
 * displayed at that point.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The ratio is a number between 0 and 255 - that specifies the relative
 * location in the square. For Linear Gradient Fills a ratio of zero is mapped
 * to the left side of the gradient square and 255 is mapped to the right side
 * of the square. For Radial Gradient Fills a ratio of zero is mapped to the
 * centre of the gradient square and 255 is mapped to the edge of the largest
 * circle that fits inside the gradient square. A ratio is used rather than
 * specifying coordinates within the gradient square as the coordinate space is
 * transformed to fit the shape that the gradient is being displayed in.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the object used to create the shape definition determines whether
 * the alpha channel is encoded in the gradient colours. Simply specifying the
 * level of transparency in the Color object is not sufficient.
 * </p>

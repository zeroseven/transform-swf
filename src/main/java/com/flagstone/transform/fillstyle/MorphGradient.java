/**
 * MorphGradient defines the control points that is used to specify how a
 * gradient fill is displayed at the start and end of the shape morphing
 * process.
 *
 * <p>
 * The ratio is a number between 0 and 255 - that specifies the relative
 * location in the square. For Linear Gradient Fills a ratio of zero is mapped
 * to the left side of the gradient square and 255 is mapped to the right side
 * of the square. For Radial Gradient Fills a ratio of zero is mapped to the
 * centre of the gradient square and 255 is mapped to the edge of the largest
 * circle that fits inside the gradient square. The color is the colour to be
 * displayed at the point identified by the ratio.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The MorphGradient defines ratios and colours for the start and end of the
 * morphing process, the Flash Player performs the interpolation between the two
 * values as the shape is morphed.
 * </p>

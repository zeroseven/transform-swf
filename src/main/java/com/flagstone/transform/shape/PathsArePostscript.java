/**
 * The PathsArePostscript class is used to notify the Flash Player that the
 * glyphs encoded in a font definition were derived from a PostScript-based font
 * definition.
 *
 * <p>
 * The PathsArePostscript is not documented in the current Macromedia Flash
 * (SWF) File Format Specification. IT was referenced in earlier editions but
 * its exact function was not known. It is thought that is used to signal to the
 * Flash Player that the paths describing the outlines of the glyphs in a font
 * were derived from a font defined using Postscript. The information can be
 * used to provide better rendering of the glyphs.
 * </P>

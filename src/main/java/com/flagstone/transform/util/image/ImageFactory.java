/**
 * <p>
 * ImageFactory is used to generate an image definition object from an image
 * stored in a file, references by a URL or read from an stream. An plug-in
 * architecture allows decoders to be registered to handle different image
 * formats. The ImageFactory provides a standard interface for using the
 * decoders.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Currently PNG, BMP and JPEG encoded images are supported by dedicated
 * decoders. The BufferedImageDecoder can be used to decode any format supported
 * using Java's ImageIO, including PNG, BMP and JPG format images. New decoders
 * can be added by implementing the ImageDecoder interface and registering them
 * in the ImageRegistry.
 * </p>
 *
 * <P>
 * The defineImage() methods return an Definition (the abstract base class for
 * all objects used to define shapes etc. in a Flash file. The exact class of
 * the object generated depends of the format of the image loaded.
 * </P>
 *
 * <table>
 * <tr>
 * <th>Class</th>
 * <th>Generated when...</th>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top">DefineJPEGImage2</td>
 * <td>A JPEG encoded image is loaded. The getFormat() method returns the class
 * constant JPEG.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top">DefineImage</td>
 * <td>An indexed BMP or PNG image contains a colour table without transparent
 * colours or when a true colour image contains 16-bit or 24-bit colours is
 * loaded. The getFormat() method returns the class constants IDX8, RGB5 or
 * RGB8.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * <tr>
 * <td valign="top">DefineImage2</td>
 * <td>A BMP or PNG indexed image contains a colour table with transparent
 * colours is loaded or when a true colour image contains 32-bit bit colours.
 * The getFormat() method returns the class constants IDXA or RGBA.</td>
 * </tr>
 *
 * </table>
 *
 * <P>
 * Images are displayed in Flash by filling a shape with the image bitmap. The
 * defineEnclosingShape() method generates a rectangular shape object which
 * wraps the image:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     int imageId = movie.newIdentifier();
 *     int shapeId = movie.newIdentifier();
 *
 *     Definition image = Image(defineImage(imageId, ...);
 *
 *     int x = image.getWidth()/2;
 *     int y = image.getHeight()/2;
 *
 *     LineStyle style = new LineStyle(20, ColorTable.black());
 *
 *     movie.add(image);
 *     movie.add(Image.defineEnclosingShape(shapeId, image, x, y, style);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <P>
 * Here the origin, used when placing the shape on the screen, is defined as the
 * centre of the shape. Other points may be defined to suit the alignment of the
 * shape when it is placed on the display list.
 * </P>
